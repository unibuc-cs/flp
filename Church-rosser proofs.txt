Theorem (Normal Order Reduction Theorem):
If a lambda term has a normal form (i.e., it is weakly normalizing), then the normal order reduction strategy will eventually find it.

Standardization Theorem:
If 𝑀 →∗ 𝑁 (i.e., M reduces to N through some reduction sequence), then there exists a standard reduction sequence from M to N.
A standard reduction sequence always reduces the leftmost, outermost redex first when possible.
